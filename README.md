üìä Insights Generation :
1. Loan Issuance Breakdown:
Good loans constitute a substantial majority at 86.18% of all issued loans, demonstrating a robust lending profile.
However, 13.82% of issued loans fall into the ""bad loan"" category, indicating a need for further scrutiny in the underwriting process.

2. Application Volume and Funding:
Good loan applications accounted for 33.2k, securing funding of $370.2 million, with $435.8 million received in payments, reflecting healthy repayment rates.
Contrastingly, bad loans consisted of 5.3k applications, with $65.5 million funded and $37.3 million received, signaling higher risk and lower repayment rates.

3.  Performance of Fully Paid Loans:
Notably, 32.1k loans have been fully paid, representing a significant portion of the portfolio.
These fully paid loans amassed a funding total of $351.4 million and received the highest payment amount of $411.6 million, underscoring reliability in repayment.

4. Risk Factors in Current Loans:
Current loans exhibit comparatively higher average interest rates (15.10%) and debt-to-income ratios (14.72%), suggesting potential risk factors in the current lending landscape that warrant closer examination and risk management strategies
